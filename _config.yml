          Established in 1941, Emmaus offers double majors in both professional and biblical studies. The institution is fully acreddited and well-respected for its emphasis on diversity, professional studies, and spiritual discipline.

          While at Emmaus, I chose to pursue a degree in Computer Information Studies as it was complimentary to my interests, personally and professionally. Coursework included Linux system administration, database administration, enterprise application design, and object oriented programming in VB and C#.

          In 2009, I dropped out for financial reasons, leaving my degree incomplete.

    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I cut my teeth on Perl, PHP, Lua, and vanilla web development as a teenager. I became interested in software development by playing with video game emulators and Linux, eventually learning C in order to get microphone and network operational. From there, I learned VB and C# .Net in college, but dropped out for financial reasons. For a while I freelanced, stocked shelves, worked a year for IBM, and then was hired by Menards. There, I put my .Net skills to use, learned Java, and fell in love with JavaScript.

      Node.js changed my entire perspective! Since 2016, I made it my mission to work full-time in the language I've grown to love. I adopted TypeScript in 2017, was contractually free to work on open-source in 2019, and I've been cultivating a deeper understanding the whole time.

      I'm proficient in web development, enterprise application architecture, parsers, and compilers. You'll find me writing open-source primarily for the Deno runtime, an alternative to Node.js where TypeScript and web standards are first-class citizens; and learning Rust in my spare time.
