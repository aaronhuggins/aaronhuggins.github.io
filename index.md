Hi, my name is Aaron. I'm a software engineer professionally since 2009, and as a hobby since 1999!

At every opportunity, I've worked to learn and execute well on teamwork, leadership skills, and inclusivity. I'm a leader and doer with a deep knowledge of enterprise applications, JavaScript, TypeScript, and agile practices. I've managed people and led teams to successful outcomes for our business in difficult circumstances and hard deadlines. I write and design small to large-scale applications and libraries, and I love to create readable code.
