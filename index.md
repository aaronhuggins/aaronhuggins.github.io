# Aaron Huggins

Software developer professionally since 2009; script kiddie since 1999!

## About me

I cut my teeth on Perl, PHP, Lua, and vanilla web development as a teenager. I became interested in software development by playing with video game emulators and Linux, eventually learning C in order to get microphone and network operational. From there, I learned VB and C# .Net in college, but dropped out for financial reasons. For a while I freelanced, stocked shelves, worked a year for IBM, and then was hired by Menards. There, I put my .Net skills to use, learned Java, and fell in love with JavaScript.

Node.js changed my entire perspective! Since 2016, I made it my mission to work full-time in the language I've grown to love. I adopted TypeScript in 2017, was contractually free to work on open-source in 2019, and I've been cultivating a deeper understanding the whole time.

I'm proficient in web development, enterprise application architecture, parsers, and compilers. You'll find me writing open-source primarily for the Deno runtime, an alternative to Node.js where TypeScript and web standards are first-class citizens; and learning Rust in my spare time.
